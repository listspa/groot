    Why not using Font Awesome 5?
  </div>

  <p>
    We have decided against using Font Awesome 5 because of its license; many useful icons
    are locked behind the Pro license. Therefore, we have - at least for the moment -
    decided that we're better off with the old version, which has a good set of icons
    and no licence issues.

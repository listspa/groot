<h1>Stylesheets</h1>

<p>
  Groot is based on <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3" target="_blank">Bootstrap v5.3</a>.
  This means that you can use the standard Bootstrap grid and components you know.
</p>

<p>
  Groot customizes Bootstrap's style by using its variables mechanism; for instance, we redefine the color
  <code>primary</code> or the fonts. However, you can override Groot's variables yourself and create a "skin".
</p>

<p>
  As an example, say you want to override the primary color to be the brand color for a customer.
  At the begging of your <code>style.scss</code> file, <i>before</i> including Groot, simply define the variable:
</p>

<pre><code>$primary: #258900</code></pre>

<p>
  With this definition the nav bar, the highlight of form fields, and so on will respect your new color.
</p>

<p>
  There are too many variables to document; please refer to the source file <a
  href="https://github.com/listspa/groot/blob/master/projects/groot/src/style/_groot-variables.scss"
  target="_blank">groot-variables.scss</a> for details.
